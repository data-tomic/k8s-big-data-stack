#
# Manual Ingress resource for exposing the Trino UI.
# This is created separately because the official Trino Helm chart
# had issues generating a valid Ingress spec in our tests.
# Assumes Cert-Manager with a ClusterIssuer named 'pki-ca' is available.
# Assumes Traefik is the Ingress Controller (using IngressClass).
